							<h3>Classical Reasoning</h3>
							<p>
								Knowledge Representation and Reasoning expresses reasoning in terms of formal languages
								called <i>logics</i>. While there are many logics, we focus on <i>propositional logic</i> given
								its foundational role. In classical propositional logic, we can encode knowledge&mdash;e.g. penguins are birds, and birds fly&mdash;and infer new knowledge using <i>entailment</i>:
								<img src="eqns/entails.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 65px;">
								Classical reasoning is in many ways the foundation for more advanced forms of reasoning such as KLM-style defeasible propositional logic. We therefore begin by considering explanation in the classical case.
								<!-- and similarly, explanation in the classical case serves as the basis for our exploration of explanation for defeasible reasoning. -->
							</p>
							<h3>Explanation</h3>
							<p>
								Sometimes we want to know why certain entailments hold.
								<i>Explanation</i> tells us which statements in our knowledge base are responsible for a given entailment.
								Suppose we know the unrelated information that birds have eyes:
								<img src="eqns/explanation-2.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 35px;">
								In our work, we focus on a form of explanation known as <i>justification</i>. Justifications are minimal subsets of statements that allow us to infer a conclusion. For example, the entailment that penguins fly for the knowledge base above has the justification
								<!--Explanation shows that only some of these statements are significant to the entailment that penguins fly.
								Specifically, we find that the statements-->
								<img src="eqns/explanation-orig.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 38px;">
								since this amounts to 'just enough' information to allow for the inference that penguins fly. This illustrates how justifications correspond with how people explain inferences when reasoning: we certainly would not state 'birds have eyes' when substantiating why penguins fly.
							</p>
							<p>
								Explanation has been shown to be an important aspect of reasoning systems.
								The concept is particularly useful for knowledge base debugging but has also been shown to
								be important for user comprehension and confidence in reasoning systems.
							</p>
							<h3>Defeasible Reasoning</h3>
							<p>
								Classical reasoning can be limiting because it cannot easily model statements that <i>typically</i> hold, but for which there might be exceptions.
								Say we try to model penguins a bit more accurately by expressing that penguins do not fly in the knowledge base:
								<img src="eqns/broken-classical.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 60px;">
								Since there is both a way to infer that penguins fly and that penguins don't fly&mdash;which is impossible&mdash;classical reasoning concludes that penguins cannot exist.
								In other words, we have removed our ability to reason about penguins in any meaningful sense.

								What we actually want to express is that birds <i>typically</i> fly, and then we can add that penguins are a specific type of bird that do not fly. <i>Defeasible reasoning</i> allows us to reason with this uncertainty and enables us to describe penguins more accurately:

								<img src="eqns/defeasible.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 75px;">

								Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor propose an approach to defeasible reasoning known as the KLM approach which is defined by a series of declarative properties.
								We focus on the KLM extension to propositional logic. In the same way that classical entailment allowed us to make
								inferences from classical knowledge, notions of <i>defeasible entailment</i> enable us to reason about defeasible knowledge. The simplest and most well-known such
								notion for KLM is <i>Rational Closure</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Intuitively, Rational Closure achieves defeasible reasoning by ranking statements according to their typicality, with more general statements having a lower rank and more
								specific statements having a higher rank. We can think of this as partitioning the knowledge base into a series of levels:
								<img src="eqns/ranking.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 165px;">
								Since penguins are a specific (exceptional) kind of bird, statements about penguins are ranked higher than birds, and classical (certain) information appears in a special rank
								denoted by &infin;. We can use this ranking to make inferences by 'throwing out' the lowest rank of statements until there are no classical inconsistencies left. For example, since
								the entire knowledge base classically entails that penguins do not exist, we remove the zeroth rank when reasoning about penguins:

								<img src="eqns/ranking-2.png" class="equation" style="max-height: 167px;">

								Since there are no remaining classical inconsistencies regarding penguins, we can use classical reasoning on the remaining statements to reason defeasibly about penguins.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although not evident here, Rational Closure defines quite a conservative style of reasoning since we often 'throw away' more information than is necessary.
								<i>Relevant</i> and <i>Lexicographic Closure</i> are two different approaches that can be defined similarly but aim to retain more information so as to produce a less conservative form of reasoning.
							</p>
							<p>

								<!-- Defeasible entailment -->
								
								
								<!-- We utilize a particular approach to defeasible reasoning 
								called the KLM approach, focusing on three definitions for 
								defeasible entailment: <i>Rational Closure</i>, <i>Relevant Closure</i>
								and <i>Lexicographic Closure</i>. -->
							</p>
							<!-- <h3>Defeasible Explanation</h3>
							<p>
								Explanation has not yet been explored for defeasible reasoning apart from some introductory work.
								This work includes ideas such as weak and strong explanation which are each notions of explanation for defeasible logic.
